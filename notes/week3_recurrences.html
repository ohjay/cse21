    <div style="line-height: 1.5">
      <p>To define a recurrence, you have to figure out how to define the problem for an input, e.g. T(n), in terms of smaller inputs, e.g. T(n - 1) and T(n - 2). There are multiple ways to go about this. (Note: we focus on counting problems here.)</p>

      <p><b>1. Define T(n) = ... directly.</b></p>
      <ul class="bq">
        <li>Think about the "inductive case": what does the T(n) setting add to whatever you had before? Or: how do you get to the T(n) setting? I often motivate my thinking by trying to "build up" from the T(n - 1) setting to the T(n) setting, even if there's ultimately more to do.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, there'll be multiple options (<i>colored tiles</i>) or cases (<i>"use" or "don't use" n</i>), which'll require multiple recursive calls.</li>
        <li>If T(n) introduces elements to count which are independent of the ones that already exist (<i>handshakes</i>), add those elements directly.</li>
        <li>If T(n) introduces C elements for each of some set of elements that already exist (<i>colored tiles</i>), add C * the relevant recursive call.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>2. Work up from base cases.</b></p>
      <ul class="bq">
        <li>If you need somewhere to start, define base cases (presumably, you have to do this anyway). Write out the first X and try to figure out how the latest base case can be derived from the one(s) before it.</li>
      </ul>
